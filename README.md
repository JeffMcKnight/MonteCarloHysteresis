MonteCarloHysteresis
====================

Magnetic hysteresis curve simulation computed using Monte Carlo method developed by Dr. Neal Bertram, professor emeritus, UCSD.
Developed in Java using JUnit testing, and Swing API for GUI.
Generates anhysteretic M-H magnetic curves, simulating magnetic recording with AC bias.
 - Uses Monte Carlo method developed by Dr. Neal Bertram, professor emeritus, UCSD.
 - Developed in Java using JUnit for TDD testing, and Swing API for GUI.
